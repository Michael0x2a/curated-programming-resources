## Introduction

This page is meant to start as a **curated** list of resources for getting started in various programming languages and technologies. It doesn't try and list every single resource available, and instead links resources that are guaranteed to be high-quality.

If you're not sure where to start and which language to learn, some good beginner languages are:

- Python (general-purpose)
- Java (general-purpose; Android development)
- HTML/CSS/Javascript (websites and webapps)

### Warning 

This page is still a work-in-progress! Some sections may currently be incomplete, and some links may not yet be fully vetted. 

Any contributions are welcome! To suggest a change, either make a pull request or submit an issue using the issue tracker to the right.

## General resources

### Links to other big lists

You can find a huge and utterly massive compendium of [list of free programming books and resources on github](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md). (It used to be hosted on StackOverflow, but was moved over to Github on October 2013).

You can also find a meta "list of programming resources" aggregator here: http://resrc.io/


### Online courses

This is an increasingly popular way for universities and professionals to help guide the next generation of programmers, and as such, new resources like this are popping up all the time.

- [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) - offers free online courses in several different languages. However, Codecademy does have a tendency to teach only basic syntax, so you may need work through more tutorials after finishing Codecademy.
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) - offers free online courses in many different fields from several different well-known universities.
- [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/) - offers free computer science courses taught by industry experts, including reddit co-founder Steve Huffman.
- [edX](https://www.edx.org/) - a joint effort between MIT, Harvard, and Berkeley to provide free online versions of some of their courses.
- [OpenCulture](http://www.openculture.com/computer_science_free_courses) - similar to all of the above.
