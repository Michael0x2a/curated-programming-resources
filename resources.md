## Introduction

### Motivation and goals

Currently, we're living in a sort of "programming renaissance". Programming and computer science is become more popular then ever -- major initiatives like the [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com/us) is popularizing learning programming across the world, and the number of people interested in majoring in computer science is [growing](http://www.princeton.edu/engineering/news/archive/index.xml?id=10983) [exponentially](http://www.geekwire.com/2014/uw-computer-science-majors/). 

As a consequence, there is an increasingly huge number of resources and tutorials being produced for beginners who want to learn to code, ranging from books to online tutorials to interactive websites to massive open online courses (MOOCS) like Codecademy and Coursera.

While this is great, it can also be overwhelming for beginners -- there are almost too _many_ resources available, and it's difficult to figure out where to start. 

This page is meant to help solve that problem -- to present a **curated** list of resources for people who are either new to programming, new to a particular topic, or want to advance their skills past the beginner stage. This page doesn't try and list every single resource available, but instead links to resources that are guaranteed to be high-quality.

### Where do I start?

If you know what you want to learn about, great! Jump to that section, start browsing the links, and find something which works for you. 

If you're not sure where to start and which language to learn, some good beginner languages are:

- [Python](#python) (general-purpose; scientific and mathematical computing)
- [Java](#java) (general-purpose; Android development)
- [HTML/CSS/JavaScript](#html-css-and-javascript) (websites and webapps)
- [Scratch](#scratch) (for younger children)

Python and Java are both languages that are [commonly used to teach programming](http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-universities/fulltext) to beginners in schools and universities, and so will have a wide variety of resources available to help you learn. They're also both widely used in the industry and so are useful languages to have in your toolbelt.

Web development has been very popular lately, so there are many resources for learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, also making it suitable for learning. It also requires little to no installation and configuration on your computer. All you need is a text editor to write code -- the code will run on your web browser.

Scratch is a little different from other languages. It was designed from the ground up to be easy to use and learn -- instead of typing text, you drag and connect together "blocks" to form programs, making it a very visual language. As a result, Scratch is a good language especially for younger children (elementary schoolers, middle schoolers) or for people who dislike typing.

### How this page is organized

This page is subdivided into three parts -- first, a "General resources" section that links to sites that tend to deliver high-quality content about a variety of topics, and a "Specific resources" section that provides resources on specific programming languages or topics. 

In general, most resources available will fall between two categories -- online courses, and books + tutorials. Online courses tend to teach using video lectures, try and be more interactive, and try and emulate the structure of a course similar to ones you might take in college. In contrast, books and tutorials teach via written text and allow you to set your own pace.

### Which resource should I pick?

Whether you prefer learning by watching a video or reading text is really a matter of personal preference. _I_ personally prefer reading, but your learning style might be completely different. You may need to explore and browse several different resources before you discover how you best learn.

When possible, I'll try and leave a description for each resource describing what their goal is, and what audience they're suitable for. Some resources focus on trying to give a comprehensive introduction for beginners, other resources are more suitable for people who are already somewhat experienced in a language and want to learn more.

### Warning 

This page is still a work-in-progress, and will be updated slowly, time permitting. Some sections may currently be incomplete, and some links may not yet be fully vetted.

## General resources

### Links to other big lists

You can find a large [list of free programming books and resources on GitHub](https://ebookfoundation.github.io/free-programming-books). (It used to be hosted on StackOverflow, but was moved over to GitHub on October 2013).


### Online courses

Online courses are an increasingly popular way for universities and professionals to teach programming and computer science in a structured format. As a result, new online courses will pop up all the time, so it's worth checking these resources periodically to see what's new.

- [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) - offers free online courses in several different languages. However, Codecademy does have a tendency to teach only basic syntax, so you must work through more tutorials after finishing Codecademy. Focuses mainly on web development, Ruby, and Python.
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) - offers free online courses in many different fields from several different well-known universities. New courses are added every quarter, and content from old courses is typically archived. Because many courses appear to be new/may be a one-time thing, this page will not link to courses on Coursera unless it appears to be stable.
- [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com) - offers free computer science courses taught by industry experts. Udacity offers two kinds of courses -- regular courses and nanodegrees. Regular courses are free. Regular courses with one-on-one tutoring/code review requires a monthly fee. Nanodegrees are typically for people with some prior coding experience, and cost more money.
- [edX](https://www.edx.org) - a joint effort between MIT, Harvard, and Berkeley to provide free online versions of some of their courses.
- [OpenCulture](http://www.openculture.com/computer_science_free_courses) - similar to all of the above. Video lectures are typically available on iTunes or Youtube. Typically does **not** require you to complete assignments, unlike many other online courses.
- [MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) - static course materials taught at MIT. Unless otherwise noted, most content from this website tends to be very rigorous and fast-paced.
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) - contains a few courses on programming and computer science; does contain many more courses on all kinds of topics (especially math).
- [Stanford Engineering Everywhere](https://see.stanford.edu/Course) - static course materials taught at Stanford.

The following websites also contain a wide variety of tutorials for many different topics, but require payment and registration before you can access their courses.

- [Team Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com) - focuses on web and iOS development.
- [Lynda](http://www.lynda.com) - also includes courses on design, animation, video, business, and more.
- [PluralSight](http://www.pluralsight.com) - similar to Lynda, but with a focus on developer and IT courses.

In general, edX, OpenCulture, MIT OpenCourseware, and Stanford Engineering Everywhere tend to contain more rigorous, thorough, and demanding courses, whereas Codecademy and Khan Academy tend to focus on giving a more gentle introduction to programming. Coursera and Udacity tend to vary between these two extremes.


## Programming Languages

### C

Note: C can be a finicky and difficult-to-teach language. Although the online courses and books are a good starting point and can take you a long way, the general consensus is that the best way to learn is through reading an actual book.

In particular, I would strongly recommend that you follow the recommendations on [StackOverflow's C Book Guide and List][c-so-definitive], and use only the resources listed here if you're unable to obtain the books in the link.

- Online courses:
    - MIT Open Courseware has a few:
        - [Practical Programming in C][c-mit-practical]  
          For beginners. 
        - [Introduction to C Memory Management and C++ Object-Oriented Programming][c-mit-intro]  
          Geared towards people with prior experience in a programming language that is not C or C++.
        - [Effective Programming in C and C++][c-mit-effective]  
          Similar to the above.
- Video tutorials: N/A
- Interactive tutorials:
    - [Learn-C][c-learn-c]  
      An interactive online guide that teaches you basic C step-by-step.
- Books and tutorials (online):
   -  [C Programming][c-c-programming]  
      One of Wikibooks' featured books. Tends to focus on teaching mainly syntax. A good starting point and reference.
   -  [Build Your Own Lisp][c-lisp]  
      Walks you through how to write a Lisp interpreter in C, teaching both languages simultaneously.
    - [More free books][c-more]
- Books (paper):
    - [The C Programming Language][c-c-lang]  
      The definitive guide to C. Also known as K&R, after the authors.

### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Note: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three core technologies that runs on every web browser and makes up every webpage.

HTML is a language used to describe the _structure_ and _content_ of a webpage. CSS is used to describe the _style_ and _appearance_. JavaScript is used to add _behavior_ and _interactivity_.

The recommended learning order is typically to start with HTML and CSS, then move on to learning JavaScript once you feel you've acquired a basic understanding of the previous two.

Also note that HTML and CSS are examples of "markup languages", not "programming languages" and so will feel fairly different from JavaScript. If your goal is to learn just programming, you might want to jump straight ahead to JavaScript (or pick a different programming language!). However, since the main way to actually use JavaScript is through the web browser, you _do_ need to learn HTML and CSS at one point or another.

- Online courses:
    - Codecademy has several courses related to web development.
        - [Make a website][webdev-cc-make-website]
        - [Make an interactive website][webdev-cc-make-interactive]
        - [HTML & CSS][webdev-cc-html-css]
        - [JavaScript][webdev-cc-js]
        - [jQuery][webdev-cc-jquery]
      Please note that Codecademy focuses only on _introducing_ programming languages. It is strongly recommended that you work through a more comprehensive beginner's tutorial after finishing Codecademy.
    - So does Udacity:
        - [Intro to HTML and CSS][webdev-uda-html-css]
        - [JavaScript Basics][webdev-uda-js]  
          Does require some prior programming experience.

### PHP

Note: while PHP can be very convenient, quick, and easy to use, it's also a language viewed negatively by many programmers. (See [PHP: a fractal of bad design][php-fractal]). If you do decide to learn PHP and adopt it as your language of choice, just be aware of the fact that people will probably make fun of you at one point or another. 

Also, it's important to first learn [HTML and CSS](#html-css-and-javascript) before attempting to learn PHP. PHP is a language which attempts to "extend" and work with HTML, so may not fully make sense if you try and learn it before picking up basic web development.

### Python

Note: there are currently two versions of Python that are commonly taught and used -- Python 2, and Python 3. Python 3 is the most recent version, but for a variety of reasons Python 2 still is fairly popular among many developers.

If you're not sure which version to pick, my recommendation would be to pick the resource which looks like the best fit for you, and just use whatever version they're recommending. Luckily, the differences between the two are very minor (at least from the perspective of the beginner), so there's really no difference if you learn using Python 2 vs Python 3. 

That said, when working on your own programs, I would always pick Python 3 unless you have good reason to otherwise. The Python community, with the exception of a few holdouts, is moving towards Python 3 and abandoning Python 2.

- Online courses: 
    - University of Helsinki [MOOC Python Programming 2024][python-mooc-helsinki] 
    - edx's [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python][python-mit-intro]
